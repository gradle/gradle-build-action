    required: false
    default: ${{ github.event.repository != null && github.ref_name != github.event.repository.default_branch }}

  cache-write-only:
    description: |
      When 'true', entries will not be restored from the cache but will be saved at the end of the Job.

      A suitable key can be generated with `openssl rand -base64 16`.
      Configuration-cache data will not be saved/restored without an encryption key being provided.
    required: false

  # DEPRECATED ACTION INPUTS
  arguments:
    description: Gradle command line arguments (supports multi-line input)
    required: false
    deprecation-message: Using the action to execute Gradle directly is deprecated in favor of using the action to setup Gradle, and executing Gradle in a subsequent Step. See https://github.com/gradle/gradle-build-action?tab=readme-ov-file#use-the-action-to-setup-gradle. 

  build-root-directory:
    description: Path to the root directory of the build. Default is the root of the GitHub workspace.
